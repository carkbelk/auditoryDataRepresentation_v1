The purpose of the project is to investigate the practicality for auditory data representation within geospatial analysis. To test this hypothesis, this project focuses on the intersection of an open source Geographic Information Systems software called QGIS and external sound programs created by Dr. Frysinger. The purpose of the two semesters I worked on this project was to set the groundwork for the software to allow for Dr. Frysinger to conduct psychological testing on the feasibility of spatial analysis with the addition of audio data.
To lay the groundwork for future testing, this project aims to establish a simple, yet modular method of conducting research using a unix executable program to emulate sound. The sound program, programmed in C computer language by Dr. Frysinger, creates a simple piano key note based on an integer input. Throughout my time, the sound program is named ‘spiano’. The goal was to use the unix system of ‘piping’ to transfer the data of a user click on a map in QGIS and pipe the output data of the user click to the input of the spiano to produce a piano tone.
I researched various methods and decided to create my own QGIS plugin to allow the user to select the layer and raster band they desire to ‘hear’. The idea was to make a more user-friendly design and more easily share my work with the future of the project.

There are four main programs needed for this entire project: Python, QGIS, Qt Creator, and Dr. Frysinger’s spiano
